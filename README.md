# My Website

This is the source code for my website, [nicolaswallet.fr](https://nicolaswallet.fr). This is a simple static personal website with my resume.
It is voluntarily simple and minimalist even if I'm using Angular and TailwindCSS.

## To do

This is a list of things I want to do on this website (in no particular order) :

- [ ] Add localization
- [x] Add projects
- [ ] Improve navigation design (sidebar ?)
- [ ] Use particles.js like the old website
- [ ] Improve tags
  - [x] Create a tag component
  - [ ] Make them clickable (or add tooltips)
  - [x] Use components for tags
  - [x] Use scss for tags
- [ ] Add ng-icons
  - [ ] Replace current icons (resume)
  - [ ] Add icons for projects
- [ ] Improve contact (copy to clipboard, etc.)
- [ ] Add 404 page
- [ ] Add a blog (maybe if I have time to write something)
